<p> (1) Marcus - Visitor, Christine - Owner, Arad - Employee </p>
<p> (2) Together we will ensure we have at least one of the required queries across views. </p>
<p> (3) We will meet before the Demo to do a practice run. </p>

### Potential Challenges

1. Due to the short timeline it may be better to do a simple HTML and CSS front end since that's all that is required. Our project description listed we would do React for the front end.
2. It will be more complicated to do many views as we planned for our application since we will need to do multiple PHP pages.
